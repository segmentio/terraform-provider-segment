# segment Provider

Use the Segment provider to manage resources in your [Segment workspace](https://segment.com/docs/). This provider is built on top of Segment's [Public API](https://segment.com/docs/api/public-api/), so you must configure the provider with the proper Public API token before you can use it.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configuration for the provider
# Token can be passed through environment variable PUBLIC_API_TOKEN
provider "segment" {}
```

- `token` (String, Sensitive) The Public API token. If not set, the PUBLIC_API_TOKEN environment variable will be used.
- `url` (String) The Public API url. Defaults to 'api.segmentapis.com', but can be overwritten by supplying it as an input to the provider or as a PUBLIC_API_URL environment variable.
