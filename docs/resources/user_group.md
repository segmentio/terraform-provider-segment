# segment_user_group (Resource)

Configures a User Group. For more information, visit the [Segment docs](https://segment.com/docs/segment-app/iam/concepts/#user-groups).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) with `<id>`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = segment_user_group.example
  id = "<id>"
}
```

Otherwise, use `terraform import` with `<id>`. For example:

```console
terraform import segment_user_group.example <id>
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configures a specific user group
data "segment_workspace" "example" {}

resource "segment_label" "env_dev" {
  key   = "env"
  value = "dev"
}

resource "segment_user_group" "example" {
  name = "My user group"
  permissions = [
    {
      role_id = "abc123"
      resources = [
        {
          id   = data.segment_workspace.example.id
          type = "WORKSPACE"
          labels = [
            {
              key   = segment_label.env_dev.key
              value = segment_label.env_dev.value
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  members = ["example@segment.com"]
}
