# segment_user (Resource)

Configures a user or invite. For more information, visit the [Segment docs](https://segment.com/docs/segment-app/iam/concepts/#team-members).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) with `<user_id>`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = segment_user.example
  id = "<user_id>"
}
```

Otherwise, use `terraform import` with `<user_id>`. For example:

```console

```

 **Only users may be imported.**

## Example Usage

# Configures a specific invite/user
resource "segment_user" "example" {
  email = "example@segment.com"
  permissions = [
    {
      role_id = "abc123"
      resources = [
        {
          id   = "abc123"
          type = "WORKSPACE"
          labels = [
            {
