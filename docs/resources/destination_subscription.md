# segment_destination_subscription (Resource)

Configures a Destination subscription to an action. For more information, visit the [Segment docs](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/actions/).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) with `<destination_id>:<subscription_id>`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = segment_destination_subscription.example
  id = "<destination_id>:<subscription_id>"
}
```

Otherwise, use `terraform import` with `<destination_id>:<subscription_id>`. For example:

```console
terraform import segment_destination_subscription.example <destination_id>:<subscription_id>
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configures a specific destination subscription
resource "segment_destination_subscription" "send_to_webhook" {
  destination_id = segment_destination.webhook.id
  name           = "Webhook send subscription"
  enabled        = true
  action_id      = "abc123"
  trigger        = "type = \"track\""
  settings = jsonencode({
    "url" : "https://webhook.site/abc-123",
