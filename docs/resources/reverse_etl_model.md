Configures a Reverse ETL Model. For more information, visit the [Segment docs](https://segment.com/docs/connections/reverse-etl/).

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) with `<id>`. For example:

```terraform
import {

}
```

Otherwise, use `terraform import` with `<id>`. For example:

```console
terraform import segment_reverse_etl_model.example <id>
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configures a specific Reverse ETL model
resource "segment_reverse_etl_model" "example" {
  source_id               = segment_source.javascript.id
  name                    = "Example Reverse ETL model"
  enabled                 = true
  description             = "Example Reverse ETL model"
  query                   = "SELECT good_stuff FROM stuff"
